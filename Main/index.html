                <p>“I am an actress, a musician, a creator, and a young woman constantly learning how to live in this world with care. There are mornings when getting out of bed feels like an act of resistance. And, there are times when I have to remind myself to eat, to breathe, and to be gentle with myself. In the middle of rehearsals, auditions, deadlines, and dreams, I’ve learned that showing up for myself is just as important as showing up for the work.</p>
                <p>Music and performing are where I go to understand myself and to connect with others. These art forms give me a language for the things I can’t always name, and the courage to ask hard questions. It lets me lean into uncertainty and discover quiet, honest clarity. Whether I’m developing a new character, learning a song, or dreaming up a new project, I return again and again to the question: how am I doing today? That small act of curiosity has unlocked bigger truths about empathy, presence, and what it means to listen deeply.</p>
                <p>At its core, my work is about communication, the kind that goes beyond words. I believe that art helps us speak when we don’t know how, and hear each other more clearly. It invites us to hold space for ourselves and for those around us. Through every creative endeavor, my hope is that you feel a moment of stillness. A breath. A reminder that you are not alone and that the present moment, however messy or beautiful, is worth honoring.</p>
                <p>We can’t always control tomorrow. But we can choose to show up today with curiosity, with care, and with heart.</p>
                <p>Take a deep breath. You’re doing better than you think.”</p>
